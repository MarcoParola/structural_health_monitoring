Structural Health Monitoring

# **Project structure**
The project is composed by the following file and folder:
* **convolutional_models.ipynb** is a colab notebook containing the definition of the convolutional architectures of the different classifiers and regressors and the training of them on both clean and corrupted data
* **testing_models.ipynb** is a colab notebook where we evaluate how models built in *convolutional_models.ipynb* perform when distortion levels vary
